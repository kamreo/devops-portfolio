# ansible-automated-configuration

Creating a detailed README for your project is crucial for users to understand how to set up and use your Ansible and Vagrant environment. Here’s a step-by-step guide you might include in your README to help users get started:

## Project Title
Ansible Vagrant Example

## Description
This project sets up an environment with Vagrant-managed virtual machines and configures them using Ansible. It's designed to showcase how to automate the provisioning and management of multiple servers.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone [Your Repository URL]
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:
```
cd /path/to/your-ansible-project
```

### 3. Start Vagrant Machines
Navigate to the Vagrant directory and start up the virtual machines:
```
cd vagrant
vagrant up
```
This will read the `Vagrantfile` and provision the virtual machines as configured.

### 4. Verify Vagrant Machines
Ensure all Vagrant machines are running correctly:
```
vagrant status
```

### 5. Run the Ansible Playbook
Navigate back to the project root and run the Ansible playbook:
```
cd ..
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml
```
This command runs the `site.yml` playbook using the hosts defined in `inventory.ini`.

### 6. Verify Configuration
After the playbook execution, verify that the configuration is applied correctly to the servers. How you do this will depend on what your playbook does (e.g., if it installs a web server, you might visit the IP of one of the VMs in a browser).

### 7. Accessing the Vagrant Machines
If you need to access the Vagrant machines directly, you can SSH into them:
```
vagrant ssh server1
```
Replace `server1` with the appropriate machine name as defined in your Vagrantfile.

### 8. Stopping Vagrant Machines
When you’re done, you can stop the Vagrant machines:
```
vagrant halt
```

## Troubleshooting
- If Ansible can't connect to the Vagrant machines, ensure that SSH access is correctly set up and that the IP addresses and paths in the `inventory.ini` file are correct.
- If you encounter errors with the tasks in the Ansible playbook, check the task's documentation and ensure all required parameters are provided.
